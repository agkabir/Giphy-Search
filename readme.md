A site where a **user can search for any word**. When searching a word the application will **find a gif** using the **searched word** using the giphy api: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/
Here is how it works: The user can write some text indicating the gif he is looking for, click a button and then a gif will be found (using the searched word) and the gif will be displayed to the user.

Moreover, the user can specify how many gif results the user wants.
